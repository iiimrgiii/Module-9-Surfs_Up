# Module-9-Surfs_Up

# Overview of the analysis:
This project aims to support the proposal of opening a shop location on the island of Oahu by providing the primary investor (referred to as 'Client') with data. The data collected focuses on temperature on the island during June and December to show how the shop may perform in different environments throughout the year in order to achieve profitability year-round.

# Results:
The difference in weather between the months of december and june is very minimul. wehre the peak temp is only 2 degrees more between the two in favor of june, and the low only being 8 degrees colder in favor of december. The daily average of the temp is only off by 2 degrees with is pretty minimul in my opion. 

This goes to point out that the difference in seasons and times of the year is very minimul. Now December did have less data points so that could change it, but I dont know if that would make a massive difference if the seasons are so similar. 

# Summary:

with that information it would show  that opening the shop would be a profitable venture year round. another quiery that could be done would be the precipitation could be examined. I think this would affect the days that surfing is possible, but you would also need to know if surfing is safe in the rain and what not.
